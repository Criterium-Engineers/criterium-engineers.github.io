## Welcome to the Release Notes for CRISP by Criterium Engineers

As features are released and bugs are squashed, we will post updates to this page so that users can know what to expect.

### Sprint 5 (May 03 - May 14 2021)

#### Features
**Preliminary Action Summary (Mobile & Web)**: Now, when you have connectivity, you can trigger the generation of a Preliminary Action Summary report. This functionality is located in the 3-dot menu when you are in an inspection on CRISP Mobile. The PAS template is also available from the Web interface. The template itself is a work-in-progress, and is displaying only NCIs in the last-generation report format. This can and will be updated as needs change.

**Confirmation for Destructive Changes (Mobile)**: When the user tries to take a destructive action (deleting observations, locations, photos, or inspections), they will receive a warning. It is NOT possible to recover from these actions.

**Inspection Number Enhancement (Mobile & Web)**: On the mobile app, when creating a New Inspection the user will choose from a list of pre-defined types. Currently those include: Standard, Specialty - Window Water Test, Specialty - Mock Up, Specialty - Air Barrier, and Excluded. Excluded is by request of Deb Adams for special circumstances. Upon starting Review on the Web side, the Reviewing Engineer can choose to assign an inspection number based on where the inspection fits in with others of that type.

**Allow Report Generation from Web Regardless of Status**: Previously, reports were only allowed to be generated in certain statuses. We have unlocked the capability to generate a report no matter what status an inspection is in.

#### Bugs Fixed
**Inspection Details**: There have been instances where details such as Arrival Time or Check-in seem to disappear. Changes have been made to mitigate those occurences.

#### Other work
**Data Updates**: Changed the underlying data for several inspections per request of the Criterium Team. Where possible, we have added work items to unlock the ability for those changes to be made by authorized users.
